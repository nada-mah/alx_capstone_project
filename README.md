# ALX Capstone Project: Event Scheduler

## Project Overview:
    The Event Scheduler is an application designed to help users create, manage, and view upcoming events or appointments. Its main purpose is to provide a convenient way for users to schedule and organize their events efficiently. By solving the problem of event management, the project aims to enhance productivity and time management for its users.

## Features and Functionality:
- Event Creation: Users can easily create new events or appointments by providing relevant details such as event title, date, time, and location.
- Event Management: Users can view, edit, and delete their scheduled events. This feature enables them to make changes or cancel events as needed.
- Reminders: The application can send reminders to users before their scheduled events to ensure they don't miss any important appointments.
- Calendar Integration: The Event Scheduler can integrate with popular calendar applications, allowing users to sync their events across different platforms and devices.

## Technologies Used:
The project utilizes the following technologies, frameworks, and languages:
- HTML5 and CSS3 for the frontend user interface.
- JavaScript for interactive elements and event handling.
- Python as the backend programming language.
- Flask, a web framework, to handle routing and server-side logic.
- SQL database for storing event data.
- Libraries or frameworks for calendar integration (e.g., Google Calendar API).

## Screenshots or Demo:
    Unfortunately, there are no screenshots or live demo available at the moment.

## Roadmap and Future Enhancements:
Future enhancements for the Event Scheduler may include:
- User authentication and account management to allow multiple users to have their own personalized event schedules.
- Collaboration features, such as sharing events or inviting others to attend, enabling users to coordinate and schedule events with others.
- Integration with popular chat or communication platforms, allowing users to easily discuss or plan events within the application.
- Mobile app development to provide users with a seamless experience on their smartphones or tablets.
